# sprint-runner
tool for creating team sprint reports

some people say that spreadsheets are everything. i say that spreadsheets are great,
but there is overhead between tracking changes in a ticket directly and then transferring
that state to the spreadsheet. i say we can do better.

what if you could update your tickets with a few keystrokes at the commandline?

what if you could generate a sprint report with one command?

Spec
----

- commandline tool
- create new tickets
- close tickets
- add labels to tickets
- add complexity score to tickets
- add tickets to milestones
- generate a milestone report and publish to github via pull request

considerations
- would have to rely on a standard set of labels for semantic meaning in report generation

Implementation
